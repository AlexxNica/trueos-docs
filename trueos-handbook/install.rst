Installing |trueos|
*******************

This chapter describes how to use the graphical installer to install a
graphical desktop directly onto a hard drive or into a virtual machine
using virtualization software such as
`VirtualBox <https://www.virtualbox.org/>`_.

To begin the |trueos| installation, insert the prepared boot media and
boot the system. If the computer boots into an existing operating
system instead of the installer, reboot and check the computer's BIOS
program to ensure the drive containing the installation media is listed
first in the boot order. Save any BIOS changes and reboot.

Once the system boots it displays the menu shown in
:numref:`Figure %s <install1>`. Press :kbd:`Enter` or simply wait a few
moments and this menu automatically prompts the system to continue
booting.

   Initial Boot Menu

.. note:: See :ref:`BSD Boot Loader` for a detailed description of this
   menu.

If a key other than :kbd:`Enter` is pressed, this screen pauses
to provide additional time to review the options. If this screen is not
paused, it automatically boots into the :guilabel:`Boot Multi User`
option, displaying the first graphical installer screen, shown in the
:ref:`Language Selection` section.

The rest of this chapter describes the screens of the graphical
installer. If any problems arise with booting into the graphical
installer, please refer to the
:ref:`Installation Troubleshooting <Installation Help>` section of
this handbook.

   :ref:`Logging In`, or during an active session using the included
   :command:`fcitx` utility.

There is also an option to :guilabel:`Load config from USB`. If the
configuration from a previous installation has been saved, it can be
loaded at this time from a *FAT* formatted USB stick.

By default, |trueos| menus display in English, unless another language
is selected in the drop-down menu in this screen. The menus in |trueos|
are being continuously translated to other languages. To view the
availability of a specific language, navigate to the
`TrueOSÂ® Translation Site <http://weblate.trueos.org>`_. A language may
show less than 100% translation, indicating not all of the menus are
translated. Any untranslated menus are displayed in English. Refer to
:ref:`Become a Translator` to assist in translating the graphical menus.

.. note:: Small screens may not display the entire installer window,
   resulting in buttons at the bottom of the window being hidden and
   inaccessible. In this situation, either press :kbd:`Alt` while
   dragging the window with the mouse or press :kbd:`Alt+N` to select
   the next button of the window.

When finished reviewing this screen, click :guilabel:`Next` to move on
to the next installation screen.

.. index:: installer system selection screen
.. _System Selection:

System Selection
================

The **System Selection** screen installs a graphical desktop or
a console-based server operating system, as seen in
:numref:`Figure %s <install3>`. It also can be used for
:ref:`Restoring the Operating System`. This chapter concentrates on a
desktop installation. Refer to the :ref:`Server Installation`
instructions for installing a command-line only server.

.. _install3:

.. figure:: images/install3d.png
   :scale: 100%

   System Selection Screen

By default, :guilabel:`TrueOS Desktop (graphical interface)` is
selected. The |lumina| Desktop is installed with TrueOS, but
additional software can be installed later using
`AppCafe <https://sysadm.us/handbook/client/sysadmclient.html#appcafe>`_.

To install the desktop, click :guilabel:`Next`.

.. note:: When installing to an existing |pcbsd| or |trueos| system, a
   pop-up window asks to install to the existing pool without
   reformatting it. Press :guilabel:`OK` to keep the existing pool.
   Clicking :guilabel:`Cancel` formats the existing pool and all of
   its data. Refer to the :ref:`Upgrading from PCBSD 10.x to TrueOS`
   section for more information about this option.

.. index:: installer disk config screen
.. _Disk Selection:

Disk Selection
==============

The **Disk Selection** screen, seen in :numref:`Figure %s <install5>`,
summarizes the default disk configuration.

.. _install5:

.. figure:: images/install5d.png
   :scale: 100%

   Disk Selection Screen

.. warning:: By default, |trueos| assumes the user wants to install
   on the entire first disk. When installing |trueos| as the only
   operating system on the computer, click :guilabel:`Next` to start the
   installation. However, if this is not intended, review the rest
   of this section to determine how to layout the disk. If |trueos| is
   to be booted with another operating system, please review the section
   on :ref:`Dual Booting`.

To select the disk or partition to install |trueos|, click
:guilabel:`Customize Disk Settings` to start the |trueos| Disk Wizard,
shown in :numref:`Figure %s <install6>`.

.. _install6:

.. figure:: images/install6b.png
   :scale: 100%

   |trueos| Disk Wizard

The wizard provides two modes of operation:

* **Basic:** (default) Select this mode if to specify the installation
  partition or disk.

* **Advanced:** Select this mode to specify the installation partition
  or disk, use MBR partitioning, change the default ZFS pool name, force
  the block size used by ZFS, configure a multi-disk installation, add a
  log or cache device, encrypt the disk, or specify the filesystem
  layout.

.. warning:: Regardless of the selected mode, once the disk wizard
   completes and :guilabel:`Next` is chosen at the **Disk Selection**
   screen, a pop-up window asks to start the installation. Be sure to
   review the **Summary** area before clicking :guilabel:`Yes` and
   starting the installation. The **Disk Selection** screen is the
   **very last chance** to ensure the system is correctly configured.
   After clicking :guilabel:`Yes`, the selected hard drive or
   partition is formatted, losing any existing data.

Once finished configuring the disk, you can save your choices for
later use. Insert a FAT32 or MSDOSFS formatted USB stick and click
:guilabel:`Save Config to USB`.

Select :guilabel:`Basic` and the wizard displays the screen shown
in :numref:`Figure %s <install7>`.

.. _install7:

.. figure:: images/install7b.png
   :scale: 100%

   Disk or Partition Selection

The first hard disk is typically selected. To install on a different
disk, use the :guilabel:`Disk` drop-down menu to select the install
disk.

By default, the entirety of the selected disk is formatted. If the disk
is divided into partitions or there is an area of free space, use the
:guilabel:`Partition` drop-down menu to choose the desired partition.

.. note:: |trueos| only installs into a primary MBR partition, a GPT
   partition, or an area of free space. |trueos| cannot install into
   a secondary or an extended partition. To create an area of free
   space for installation, refer to :ref:`Creating Free Space`.

Once the disk and partition are selected, click :guilabel:`Next` to
view a **Summary** screen to review your choices. To make additional
changes, press :guilabel:`Back` to return to a previous screen.
Otherwise, click :guilabel:`Finish` to leave the wizard. Click
:guilabel:`Next` then :guilabel:`Yes` to start the installation.

.. _Advanced Mode:

Advanced Mode
-------------

After selecting advanced mode, the wizard displays the screen shown in
:numref:`Figure %s <install8>`.

.. _install8:

.. figure:: images/install8c.png
   :scale: 100%

   Advanced Mode Options

This screen has several options:

* **Disk:** Choose the install disk.

* **Partition:** Select the desired partition or area of free space.

.. note:: |trueos| onlys install into a primary MBR partition, a GPT
   partition, or an area of free space. |trueos| cannot install into
   a secondary or an extended partition. To create an area of free
   space for installation, refer to :ref:`Creating Free Space`.

* **Partition Scheme:**  The default
  :guilabel:`GPT (Best for new hardware)` is a partition table layout
  supporting larger partition sizes than the traditional
  :guilabel:`MBR (Legacy)` layout. **If the installation disk or
  partition is larger than 2 TB, the GPT option must be selected**.
  Since some older motherboards do not support GPT, if the installation
  fails, try again with :guilabel:`MBR (Legacy)` selected. When in
  doubt, use the default selection.

.. note:: The **Partition Scheme** section does not appear if a
   partition other than :guilabel:`Use entire disk` is chosen in the
   :guilabel:`Partition` drop-down menu.

* **ZFS pool name:** To use a pool name other than *tank* (default),
  check this box and type the name of the pool in the text window.
  *Root* is reserved and can not be used as a pool name.

* **Force ZFS 4k block size:** This option is only used if the disk
  supports 4k, even though the disk may lie and report its size as
  512b. Use with caution as it may cause the installation to fail.

After making any selections, click :guilabel:`Next` to access the ZFS
configuration screens. The rest of this section provides a ZFS overview
and then demonstrates how to customize the ZFS layout.

ZFS Overview
^^^^^^^^^^^^

ZFS is an enterprise grade file-system, which provides many features.
These include: support for high storage capacities, high reliability,
the ability to quickly take snapshots, boot environments, continuous
integrity checking and automatic repair, RAIDZ which was designed to
overcome the limitations of hardware RAID, and native NFSv4 ACLs.

If new to ZFS, the Wikipedia entry on :wiki:`ZFS` provides an
excellent starting point to learn about its features. Additionally,
`FreeBSD Mastery: ZFS <https://www.michaelwlucas.com/os/fmzfs>`_
by Michael W Lucas and Allan Jude is a helpful ZFS resource as it
is implemented in FreeBSD.

These resources are also useful to bookmark and peruse as needed:

   :class: longtable

   +----------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
   | Term     | Description                                                                                                                                  |
   +==========+==============================================================================================================================================+
   | Pool     | A collection of devices providing physical storage and data replication managed by ZFS. This pooled storage model eliminates the concept of  |
   |          | volumes and the associated problems of partitions, provisioning, wasted bandwidth, and stranded storage. Thousands of filesystems can draw   |
   |          | from a common storage pool, each one consuming only its required space. The combined I/O bandwidth of all devices in the pool is available   |
   |          | at all times to all filesystems. The `Storage Pools Recommendations <http://zqscm.qiniucdn.com/data/20091118230710/index.html>`_ of the ZFS  |
   |          | Best Practices Guide provides detailed recommendations for creating the storage pool.                                                        |
   +----------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
   | Mirror   | A form of RAID where all data is mirrored onto two or more disks, creating a redundant copy should a disk fail.                              |
   +----------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
   | RAIDZ    | ZFS software solution equivalent to RAID5, as it allows one disk to fail without losing data. Requires at least *3* disks.                   |
   +----------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
   | RAIDZ2   | Double-parity ZFS software solution similar to RAID6, as it allows two disks to fail without losing data. Requires a minimum of *4* disks.   |
   +----------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
   | RAIDZ3   | Triple-parity ZFS software solution. RAIDZ3 offers three parity drives and can operate in degraded mode if up to three drives fail with no   |
   |          | restrictions on which drives can fail.                                                                                                       |
   +----------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
   | Dataset  | Once a pool is created, it can be divided into datasets. A dataset is similar to a folder as it supports permissions. A dataset is also      |
   |          | similar to a filesystem since properties such as quotas and compression can be set.                                                          |
   +----------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
   | Snapshot | A read-only, point-in-time copy of a filesystem. Snapshots can be created quickly and, if little data changes, new snapshots take very       |
   |          | little space. For example, a snapshot with no changed files takes 0 MB of storage, but a changed 10 GB file will store both old and new      |
   |          | versions. Snapshots provide a clever way of keeping a history of files, should an older copy or even a deleted file need to be recovered.    |
   |          | For this reason, many administrators snapshot often (e.g. every 15 minutes), store them for a period of time (e.g. for a month), and store   |
   |          | them on another system. Such a strategy allows the administrator to roll the system back to a specific time, or if there is a catastrophic   |
   |          | loss, an off-site snapshot can restore the system up to the last snapshot interval (e.g. within 15 minutes of the data loss). Snapshots can  |
   |          | be cloned or rolled back, but the files on the snapshot can not be accessed independently.                                                   |
   +----------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
   | Clone    | A writable copy of a snapshot which can only be created on the same ZFS volume. Clones provide an extremely space efficient way to store     |
   |          | many copies of mostly-shared data such as workspaces, software installations, and diskless clients. Clones do not inherit the properties of  |
   |          | the parent dataset, but rather inherit the properties based on where the clone is created in the ZFS pool. Because a clone initially shares  |
   |          | all its disk space with the original snapshot, its used property is initially zero. As changes are made to the clone, it uses more space.    |
   +----------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
   | ZIL      | A filesystem journal that manages writes. The ZIL is a temporary storage area for sync writes until they are written asynchronously to the   |
   |          | ZFS pool. If the system has many sync writes, such as from a database server, performance can be increased by adding a dedicated log device  |
   |          | known as a SLOG (Secondary LOG). If the system has few sync writes, a SLOG will not speed up writes. When creating a dedicated log device,   |
   |          | it is recommended to use a fast SSD with a supercapacitor or a bank of capacitors able to handle writing the contents of the SSD's RAM to    |
   |          | the SSD. If a dedicated log device is needed, the SSD should be half the size of system RAM, as anything larger is unused capacity. Note a   |
   |          | dedicated log device can not be shared between ZFS pools, and the same device cannot hold both a log and a cache device.                     |
   +----------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
   | L2ARC    | ZFS uses a RAM cache to reduce read latency. If an SSD is dedicated as a cache device, it is known as an L2ARC and ZFS uses it to store more |
   |          | reads which can increase random read performance. However, adding a cache device will not improve a system with too little RAM and actually  |
   |          | decreases performance, as ZFS uses RAM to track the contents of L2ARC. RAM is always faster than disks, so always add as much RAM as         |
   |          | possible before determining if the system would benefit from a L2ARC device. If a lot of applications do large amounts of random reads on a  |
   |          | dataset small enough to fit into the L2ARC, read performance may be increased by adding a dedicated cache device. SSD cache devices only     |
   |          | help if the working set is larger than system RAM, but small enough that a significant percentage of it fits on the SSD. Note a dedicated    |
   |          | L2ARC device can not be shared between ZFS pools.                                                                                            |

.. _ZFS Layout:

ZFS Layout
^^^^^^^^^^

In :guilabel:`Advanced Mode`, the disk setup wizard allows configuring
the ZFS layout. The initial ZFS configuration screen is seen in
:numref:`Figure %s <install9>`.

.. _install9:

.. figure:: images/install9b.png
   :scale: 100%

   ZFS Configuration

If the system contains multiple drives to be used to create a ZFS mirror
or RAIDZ*, check :guilabel:`Add additional disks to storage pool`, which
enables this screen. Any available disks are listed in the box below the
:guilabel:`ZFS Virtual Device Mode` drop-down menu. Select the desired
level of redundancy from the :guilabel:`ZFS Virtual Device Mode`
drop-down menu, then check the box for each disk to add to the
configuration.

.. note:: The |trueos| installer requires entire disks (not partitions)
   when adding more disks to the pool.

While ZFS allows using disks of different sizes, this is discouraged as
it decreases storage capacity and ZFS performance.

The |trueos| installer supports multiple ZFS configurations:

* **mirror:** Requires a minimum of 2 disks.

* **RAIDZ1:** Requires a minimum of 3 disks. For best performance,
  a maximum of 9 disks is recommended.

* **RAIDZ2:** Requires a minimum of 4 disks. For best performance, a
  maximum of 10 disks is recommended.

* **RAIDZ3:** Requires a minimum of 5 disks. For best performance, a
  maximum of 11 disks is recommended.

* **stripe:** Requires a minimum of 2 disks.

.. danger:: A stripe does NOT provide ANY redundancy. If any disk fails
   in a stripe, all data in the pool is lost!

The installer does not allow a configuration choice in which the system
does not meet the required number of disks. When selecting a
configuration, a message indicates how many more disks are required.

When finished, click :guilabel:`Next` to choose cache and log devices,
shown in :numref:`Figure %s <install10>`.

.. _install10:

.. figure:: images/install10b.png
   :scale: 100%

   L2ARC and ZIL

This screen can be used to specify an SSD as an L2ARC read cache or as a
secondary log device (ZIL). Any available devices are listed in the
boxes in this screen.

.. note:: A separate SSD is needed for each type of device.

Refer to the descriptions for ZIL and L2ARC in the :ref:`ZFS Overview`
to determine if the system would benefit from any of these devices
before adding them in this screen. When finished, click :guilabel:`Next`
to move to the encryption options, shown in
:numref:`Figure %s <install11>`.

.. _install11:

.. figure:: images/install11c.png
   :scale: 100%

   Encryption

This screen can be used to configure full-disk encryption. This is
meant to protect the data on the disks should the system itself be
lost or stolen. This type of encryption prevents the data on the disks
from being available during bootup unless the correct passphrase is
typed at the bootup screen. Once the passphrase is accepted, the data
is unencrypted and can easily be read from disk.

To configure full-disk encryption, check
:guilabel:`Encrypt disk with GELI`. This option will be greyed out if
:guilabel:`GPT (Best for new hardware)` is not selected as GELI does not
support MBR partitioning. If needed, use :guilabel:`Back` to go back to
the :ref:`Advanced Mode` screen and select
:guilabel:`GPT (Best for new hardware)`. Once that box is checked, input
a strong passphrase twice into the :guilabel:`Password` fields. It is
recommended to create a long and memorable password, but something
difficult to guess.

.. danger:: This passphrase is required to decrypt the disks. If the
   passphrase is lost or forgotten, all access will be lost to the
   encrypted data!

When finished, click :guilabel:`Next` to move to the mount point screen
shown in :numref:`Figure %s <install12>`.

.. _install12:

.. figure:: images/install12b.png
   :scale: 100%

   Default ZFS Layout

Regardless of how many disks are selected for the ZFS configuration, the
default layout is the same. ZFS does not require separate partitions for
:file:`/usr`, :file:`/tmp`, or :file:`/var`. Instead, create one ZFS
partition (pool) and specify a mount for each dataset. A :file:`/boot`
partition is not mandatory with ZFS as the |trueos| installer puts a
64k partition at the beginning of the drive.

.. warning:: Do not remove any of the default mount points. These are
   all used by |trueos|.

Use :guilabel:`Add` to add additional mount points. The system will ask
for the name of the mount point as size is not limited at creation time.
Instead, the data on any mount point can continue to grow as long as
space remains within the ZFS pool.

To set the swap size, click :guilabel:`Swap Size`. This prompts you to
enter a size in MB. If a RAIDZ* or mirror exists, a swap partition
of the specified size is created on each disk and mirrored between the
drives. For example, if a 2048 MB swap size is specified, a 2 GB swap
partition is created on all the specified disks, but the total swap
size is 2GB because of redundancy.

Right-click any mount point to toggle between enabling or disabling many
ZFS properties:

* **atime:** When set to :guilabel:`on`, controls whether the access
  time for files is updated when they are read. When set to
  :guilabel:`off`, this property avoids producing write traffic when
  reading files. This can result in significant performance gains,
  though it may confuse mailers and other utilities.

* **canmount:** If set to :guilabel:`off`, the filesystem is
  unmountable.

* **casesensitivity:** The default is :guilabel:`sensitive`, as UNIX
  filesystems use case-sensitive file names. For example, "kris" is
  different from "Kris". To tell the dataset to ignore case, select
  :guilabel:`insensitive`.

* **checksum:** Automatically verifies the integrity of the data
  stored on disks. Turning this property :guilabel:`off` is highly
  discouraged.

* **compression:** If set to :guilabel:`on`, automatically compresses
  stored data to conserve disk space.

* **exec:** If set to :guilabel:`off`, processes can not be executed
  from within this filesystem.

* **setuid:** If set to :guilabel:`on`, the set-UID bit is respected.

After clicking :guilabel:`Next`, the wizard shows a summary of the
selections. To make further changes, use :guilabel:`Back` to return to
a previous screen. Otherwise, click :guilabel:`Finish` to leave the
wizard and return to the :guilabel:`Disk Selection` screen.

* :ref:`Restoring the Operating System`

* :ref:`Dual Booting`

* :ref:`Using the System Utilities Menu`

* :ref:`Upgrading from PCBSD 10.x to TrueOS`

* :ref:`Automated Installations`

If your intent is to install a graphical desktop using the graphical
installer, instead refer to :ref:`Installing TrueOS`.

.. index:: install a server
.. _Server Installation:

Server Installation
-------------------

The :ref:`System Selection` screen of the |trueos| installer can be
used to install a FreeBSD-based command-line server operating system
rather than a graphical desktop operating system. A |trueos| server
installation includes the `SysAdmâ¢ API <https://api.sysadm.us/>`_ and
`SysAdmâ¢ Client <https://sysadm.us/handbook/client/>`_ for managing the
server locally or remotely.

For a server installation, using the |trueos| installer rather than the
FreeBSD installer offers several benefits:

* The ability to easily configure ZFS during installation.

* The ability to configure multiple boot environments.

* A wizard (described in this section) is provided during installation
  to configure the server for first use.

To perform a server installation, start the |trueos| installation as
usual. At the :ref:`System Selection` screen of the installer, select
:guilabel:`TrueOS Server (console interface only)`.

Click :guilabel:`Next` to start the :guilabel:`Server Setup Wizard`,
then click :guilabel:`Next` again to see the screen shown in
:numref:`Figure %s <server2>`.

.. _server2:

.. figure:: images/server2a.png

   Root Password Creation

Input and confirm the root password then click :guilabel:`Next` to
proceed to the screen shown in :numref:`Figure %s <server3>`.

.. _server3:

.. figure:: images/server3a.png
   :scale: 100%

   Primary User Account Creation

For security reasons, do not login as the **root** user. The wizard
requires creating a primary user account for logging into the server.
This account is automatically added to the *wheel* group, allowing
the user to :command:`su` to the **root** account when administrative
access is required.

Create an account by filling in these fields:

* **Name:** Can contain capital letters and spaces.

* **Username:** The name to use for logging in. It cannot contain
  spaces and is case sensitive (e.g. *Kris* is a different username
  than *kris*).

* **Password:** The password to use for logging in. Type it twice to
  confirm it.

* **Default shell:** Use the drop-down menu to select the **csh**,
  **tcsh**, **sh**, or **bash** login shell.

When finished, click :guilabel:`Next` to proceed to
:numref:`Figure %s <server4>`.

.. _server4:

.. figure:: images/server4a.png
   :scale: 100%

   Hostname Creation

Input the system's hostname. If using :command:`ssh` to connect to the
system, check :guilabel:`Enable remote SSH login`. Click
:guilabel:`Next` to proceed to the network configuration screen shown in
:numref:`Figure %s <server5>`.

.. _server5:

.. figure:: images/server5a.png
   :scale: 100%

   Network Configuration

Use the :guilabel:`Network Interface` drop-down menu to choose the
desired interface:

* **AUTO-DHCP-SLAAC:** (default) Will configure every active interface
  for DHCP and for both IPv4 and IPv6.

* **AUTO-DHCP:** Will configure every active interface for DHCP and
  for IPv4.

* **IPv6-SLAAC:** Will configure every active interface for DHCP and
  for IPv6.

Alternately, use the drop-down menu to select the device name for the
interface and manually configure and input the IPv4 and/or IPv6
addressing information. When finished, click :guilabel:`Next` to access
the screen shown in :numref:`Figure %s <server6>`.

.. _server6:

.. figure:: images/server6a.png
   :scale: 100%

   Optional Install Features

To install the FreeBSD ports collection, check
:guilabel:`Install ports tree` then click :guilabel:`Finish` to exit the
wizard and access the summary screen shown in :ref:`Disk Selection`.

If installing the server to a system with ZFS already installed, you can
choose to :guilabel:`Install to disk` or
:guilabel:`Install into boot Environment`.

When installing to disk, click :guilabel:`Customize Disk Settings` to
configure the system's disk(s). When installing into a Boot Environment,
you can select the ZFS Pool for installation using the drop-down menu.

To save the install configuration for re-use at a later time, insert a
MSDOSFS or FAT32 formatted USB stick and click
:guilabel:`Save Config to USB`.

When ready to continue, click :guilabel:`Next`. A new window asks if you
are ready to begin the installation. Click :guilabel:`Yes` to continue
or :guilabel:`No` to continue modifying the install configuration.

Once the system is installed, it boots to a command-line login
prompt. Login using the primary user account configured during
installation. Now the server can be configured like any other FreeBSD
server installation. The
`FreeBSD Handbook <https://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/>`_
is an excellent reference for performing common FreeBSD server tasks.

.. index:: Restore from Life Preserver backup
.. _Restoring the Operating System:

Restore from Life Preserver backup
----------------------------------

If you have replicated the system's snapshots to a remote backup
server, you can use a |trueos| installation media to perform an
operating system restore or to clone another system. Start the
installation as usual and select to
:guilabel:`Restore from Life Preserver backup` in the
:ref:`System Selection Screen <install3>`.

Before you can perform a restore, the network interface must be
configured. Click the :guilabel:`Network Connectivity` (blue circle)
icon in order to determine if the network connection was automatically
detected. If not, refer to the instructions in the
:ref:`Network Manager` section of this handbook and ensure networking is
functional before continuing.

Once you are ready, click :guilabel:`Restore from Life Preserver backup`
and :guilabel:`Next`. This starts the Restore Wizard. In the
**SSH Restore** shown in :numref:`Figure %s <restore2>`, type the IP
address of the backup server and the name of the user account that
replicated the snapshots. If the server is listening on a non-standard
SSH port, change the :guilabel:`SSH port` number.

.. _restore2:

.. figure:: images/restore2.png
   :scale: 100%

   : Beginning a SSH Restore

Click :guilabel:`Next` and the wizard provides a summary of your
selections. If correct, click :guilabel:`Finish`. Otherwise, click
:guilabel:`Back` to correct them.

Once the connection to the backup server succeeds, you can select which
host to restore. After making your selection, click :guilabel:`Next`.
The restore wizard provides a summary of which host it restores from,
the name of the user account associated with the replication, and
the hostname of the target system. Click :guilabel:`Finish` and the
installer proceeds to the :ref:`Disk Selection Screen <install5>`. At
this point, you can click :guilabel:`Customize` to customize the disk
options. However, any ZFS datasets will be greyed out as they are to be
recreated from the backup during the restore. Once you are finished
with any further customizations, click :guilabel:`Next` to perform the
restore.

.. index:: install with dualboot
.. _Dual Booting:

Dual Booting
------------

A |trueos| installation assumes there is an existing GPT or primary
partition to install into. If the computer has only one disk and
|trueos| is the only operating system, it is fine to accept the default
partitioning scheme. However, if |trueos| will be sharing space with
other operating systems, ensure |trueos| is installed into the correct
partition or an existing operating system may be inadvertently
overwritten.

There are several required elements to install multiple operating
systems on the computer:

* A partition for each operating system. Many operating systems,
  including |trueos|, can only be installed into a primary or GPT
  partition. This means partitioning software is required, as described
  in :ref:`Creating Free Space`.

* A backup of any existing data. It is recommended to store this backup
  on a different computer, removable media such as a USB drive, or burnt
  onto a DVD media. While most installations progress smoothly, it is
  always recommended to have a backup prepared.

When installing |trueos| onto a computer that is to contain multiple
operating systems, carefully select the **correct** partition in the
:ref:`Disk Selection` screen. On a system containing multiple
partitions, each partition is listed.

.. danger:: Avoid selecting a partition containing an operating system
   or essential data.

Highlight the desired partition and click :guilabel:`Customize`.
Clicking :guilabel:`Next` without customizing the disk layout results
in the installer overwriting the contents of the primary disk.

In |trueos|, the BSD boot loader is the default boot loader, as it
provides native support for ZFS boot environments.

.. index:: using system utilities menu
.. _Using the System Utilities Menu:

Using the System Utilities Menu
-------------------------------

The System Utilities menu is available from the "Emergency Shell" icon
(see :ref:`insico`) in the various |trueos| installer screens. Once
opened, you'll see the menu shown in :numref:`Figure %s <util1>`.

.. TODO update screenshot once fixgrub option is removed.

.. _util1:

.. figure:: images/util1a.png
   :scale: 100%

   System Utilities Menu

This screen provides several options:

* **shell:** This option is useful when troubleshooting a |trueos|
  system that no longer boots. It opens a shell with administrative
  access, including the base FreeBSD utilities. Advanced users can use
  this shell to identify a problem, create a backup or copy essential
  files to another system, or alter configuration files with an editor
  like `ee <https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=ee>`_ or
  :command:`vi`. When finished using the shell, type :command:`exit` to
  return to the :ref:`System Utilities Menu <util1>`.

* **zimport** This option displays the names of available ZFS pools.
  Type the name of an available pool and the utility imports the pool
  then displays the available boot environments (BEs). Type the name of
  the desired BE and **zimport** mounts the BE then offers to open a
  chroot shell so the environment's contents can be viewed and edited
  as needed in order to perform maintenance on the boot environment.
  When finished, type :command:`exit` to leave the boot environment and
  return to the :ref:`System Utilities Menu <util1>`.

* **exit:** This option returns the user to the main
  :ref:`TrueOSÂ® Installation Menu <install1>`.

.. index:: upgrade from PCBSD
.. _Upgrading from PCBSD 10.x to TrueOS:

Upgrading from |pcbsd| 10.x to |trueos|
---------------------------------------

.. warning:: If any user account uses PersonaCrypt, please be sure to
   save any encryption keys to a safe place (e.g. a thumb drive) before
   beginning the upgrade process. Loss of encryption keys may result in
   being unable to import the home directory after the upgrade is
   complete.

If the system is using |pcbsd| 10.x, the option to update to |trueos|
does not appear in the Control Panel version of Update Manager. This is
because a new installation is required in order to migrate to |trueos|.
However, the |trueos| installer allows the user to keep all their
existing data and home directories as it provides the ability to
install |trueos| into a new boot environment. In other words, the new
operating system and updated applications are installed while the ZFS
pool and any existing boot environments are preserved. Since the new
install is in a boot environment, the option to boot back into the
previous |pcbsd| installation remains.

.. note:: This option overwrites the contents of :file:`/etc`. If any
   custom configurations exist, save them to a backup or the home
   directory first. Alternately, use the |sysadm|
   `Boot Environment Manager <https://sysadm.us/handbook/client/sysadmclient.html#boot-environment-manager>`_
   post-installation to mount the previous |pcbsd| boot environment to
   copy over any configuration files which may not have been backed up.

To perform the installation to a new boot environment, start the
|trueos| installation as described earlier in the chapter. In the
:ref:`System Selection` screen, choose to install either a desktop or
a server. Press :guilabel:`Next` to view the :guilabel:`Disk Selection`
screen, shown in :numref:`Figure %s <upgrade1>`.

.. _upgrade1:

.. figure:: images/upgrade1b.png

   Disk Selection

|trueos| automatically detects if the drive has an existing boot
environment, filling in the data as necessary. If no boot environments
are detected, :guilabel:`Install into Boot Environment` is invisible.
To upgrade, select :guilabel:`Install into Boot Environment` and
choose which existing pool to install into from the drop-down menu. In
the :ref:`Disk Selection Screen <upgrade1>`, the user is installing into
the existing **tank** pool. Press :guilabel:`Next` when ready.

.. warning:: Be sure :guilabel:`Install into Boot Environment` is
   checked before proceeding, or data can be lost.

A pop-up will appear, asking to start the default Full-Disk
installation. Click :guilabel:`Yes` to begin the installation.

Once the installation is complete, reboot the system and remove the
installation media. The post-installation screens run as described in
the :ref:`Post Installation Configuration` section to help you configure
the new installation.

.. warning:: During the :ref:`Create a User` process, recreate the primary
   user account using the same user name and user id (UID) from the
   previous |pcbsd| system. This allows |trueos| to associate the
   existing home directory with that user. Once logged in, use the
   |sysadm|
   `User Manager <https://sysadm.us/handbook/client/sysadmclient.html#user-manager>`_
   to recreate any other user accounts or to reassociate any
   PersonaCrypt accounts.

.. index:: automated installations
.. _Automated Installations:

Automated Installations
-----------------------

|trueos| provides a set of Bourne shell scripts to allow advanced
users to create automatic or customized |trueos| installations.
:command:`pc-sysinstall` is the name of the master script. The script
reads a customizable configuration file and uses dozens of backend
scripts to perform the installation. Read more about this utility by
typing :command:`man pc-sysinstall`.

Here is a quick overview of the components used by
:command:`pc-sysinstall`:

* :file:`/usr/local/share/pc-sysinstall/backend/` contains the scripts
  used by the |trueos| installer. Scripts have been divided by function,
  such as :file:`functions-bsdlabel.sh` and
  :file:`functions-installcomponents.sh`. To learn more about how the
  |trueos| installer works, read through these scripts. This directory
  also contains the :file:`parseconfig.sh` and
  :file:`startautoinstall.sh` scripts which :command:`pc-sysinstall`
  uses to parse the configuration file and begin the installation.

* :file:`/usr/local/share/pc-sysinstall/backend-query/` contains the
  scripts used by the installer to detect and configure hardware.

* :file:`/usr/local/share/pc-sysinstall/conf/` contains the
  configuration file :file:`pc-sysinstall.conf`. It also contains a
  file indicating which localizations are available
  (:file:`avail-langs`), an :file:`exclude-from-upgrade` file, and a
  :file:`licenses/` subdirectory containing text files of applicable
  licenses.

* :file:`/usr/local/share/pc-sysinstall/doc/` contains the help text
  seen if :command:`pc-sysinstall` is run without any arguments.

* :file:`/usr/local/share/pc-sysinstall/examples/` contains several
  example configuration files for different scenarios (e.g.
  :file:`upgrade` and :file:`fbsd-netinstall`). The :file:`README` in
  this directory should be considered as **mandatory** reading before
  using :command:`pc-sysinstall`.

* :file:`/usr/sbin/pc-sysinstall` is the script used to perform a
  customized installation.

This section discusses the steps needed to create a custom installation.

First, determine which variables to customize. A list of possible
variables can be found in
:file:`/usr/local/share/pc-sysinstall/examples/README` and are
summarized in :numref:`Table %s <insvars>`.

.. note:: This table is meant as a quick reference to determine which
   variables are available. The :file:`README` in
   :file:`/usr/local/share/pc-sysinstall/examples/` contains more
   complete descriptions for each variable.

Next, create a customized configuration. One way to create a
customized configuration file is to read through the configuration
examples in :file:`/usr/local/share/pc-sysinstall/examples/` and follow
the most relevant example. Copy the file to any location and customize
it so it includes the desired variables and values in the installation.

An alternate way to create this file is to start an installation,
configure the system as desired, and save the configuration to a USB
stick (with or without actually performing the installation). Use the
saved configuration file as-is, or customize it to meet an
installation's needs. This method may prove easier when performing
complex disk layouts.

To perform a fully automated installation which does not prompt for any
user input, review
:file:`/usr/local/share/pc-sysinstall/examples/pc-autoinstall.conf`
and place a customized copy of the file into
:file:`/boot/pc-autoinstall.conf` on the installation media.

:numref:`Table %s <autovars>` summarizes the additional variables
available for fully automatic installations. More detailed descriptions
can be found in the
:file:`/usr/local/share/pc-sysinstall/examples/pc-autoinstall.conf`
file.

.. note:: The variables in this file use a different syntax than those
   in :ref:`Customizing a TrueOSÂ® Installation <insvars>` as the values
   follow a colon (:kbd:`:`) and a space rather than an :kbd:`=` sign.

Finally, create a custom installation media or installation server.
:command:`pc-sysinstall` supports two installation methods:

1. From CD, DVD, or USB media.

2. From an installation directory on an HTTP, FTP, or SSH+rsync server.

The easiest way to create a custom installation media is to modify an
existing installation image. For example, if an ISO for the |trueos|
version to customize is downloaded, the superuser can access the
contents of the ISO with a few commands:

.. code-block:: none

 [name@example] mdconfig -a -t vnode -f TrueOS-Desktop-2016-08-11-x64-DVD.iso.md5 -u 1

 [name@example] mount -t cd9660 /dev/md1 /mnt

Make sure to :command:`cd` into the desired destination directory for
the copied ISO contents. In the next examples,
:file:`/tmp/custominstall/` was created for this purpose:

.. code-block:: none

 [name@example] cd /tmp/custominstall

 [name@example] tar -C /mnt -cf - . | tar -xvf -

 [name@example] umount /mnt

Alternately, if an installation CD or DVD is inserted, mount the media
and copy its contents to the desired directory

.. code-block:: none

 [name@example] mount -t cd9660 /dev/cd0 /mnt

 [name@example] cp -R /mnt/* /tmp/custominstall/

 [name@example] umount /mnt

If creating an automated installation, copy the customized
:file:`pc-autoinstall.conf` to :file:`/tmp/custominstall/boot/`.

Copy the customized configuration file to :file:`/tmp/custominstall/`.
Double-check the :command:`installMedium=` variable in the customized
configuration file is set to the correct installation media.

Adding extra files may be necessary if certain variables are set in the
custom configuration file:

* **installComponents=** Any extra components to install must exist in
  :file:`extras/components/`.

* **runCommand=** The command must exist in the specified path.

* **runScript=** Make sure the script exists in the specified path.

* **runExtCommand=** Ensure the command exists in the specified
  path.

If the installation media is a CD or DVD, create a bootable media
containing the files in the directory. To create a bootable ISO:

.. code-block:: none

 [name@example] cd /tmp/custominstall

 [name@example] mkisofs -V mycustominstall -J -R -b boot/cdboot -no-emul-boot -o myinstall.iso

Use a preferred burning utility to burn the ISO to the media.

To begin an installation that requires user interaction, type
:command:`pc-sysinstall -c /path_to_your_config_file`

To begin a fully automated installation, insert the installation media
and reboot.

If using an HTTP, FTP, or SSH server as the installation media,
:command:`untar` or copy the required files to a directory on the
server accessible to users. Be sure to configure the server so
installation files are accessible to the systems to install.
