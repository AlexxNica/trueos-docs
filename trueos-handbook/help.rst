Finding Help
************

The TrueOS® Project strives to make using TrueOS® as easy as possible
for newcomers. Should you need help, there are plenty of ways to get
in touch with the TrueOS® community. This chapter describes the
available resources.

As your teacher may have told you, "there is no such thing as a stupid
question". However, there are ways to ensure that you receive the
response you seek and that it will be a productive exchange for all
parties involved. The two articles below describe how and why it is
important to follow certain protocols when requesting help: 

* `How to Ask Smart Questions (PDF) <http://divajutta.com/doctormo/foo/ask-smart-questions.pdf>`_

* `How To Ask Questions The Smart Way <http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html>`_

.. _FreeBSD Handbook and FAQ:

FreeBSD Handbook and FAQ
========================

TrueOS® uses FreeBSD as its underlying operating system, so everything in the `FreeBSD Handbook <http://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/>`_ and
`FreeBSD FAQ <http://www.freebsd.org/doc/en/books/faq/>`_ applies to TrueOS® as well. Both documents are comprehensive and cover nearly every task you
can accomplish on a FreeBSD system. They are also an excellent resource for learning how things work under the hood of your TrueOS® system.

.. note:: some configurations described in the FreeBSD Handbook already "just work" on your TrueOS® system as they have been pre-configured for you. In these
   instances, reading that FreeBSD Handbook section can help you to understand how your system is configured and why it works.
