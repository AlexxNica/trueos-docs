"A virtualized environment allows you to test drive an operating system "
"without overwriting your current operating system. This is an excellent way "
"to practice installation, determine whether all of your hardware is "
"supported, or to try multiple versions of different operating systems. "
"Virtualization software effectively creates windows (known as virtual "
"machines) into which you can install and use an operating system. The only "
"limitation to virtualization is your hardware as each virtual machine uses "
"CPU and RAM. Depending upon the amount of CPU and RAM in your computer, you "
"may find that the operating system you install using virtualization software"
" runs slowly. If your computer slows down, try closing other applications "
"running on your computer to free up some RAM."
